This bundle offers a new type of transport for the Symfony Messenger component. While MongoDB is not the best tool to be used as a queue, sometimes it's more convenient to use the tools that your application already uses. For example, if your application already uses MongoDB and you want a persistent storage for the failed messages, I think it's quite handy to use MongoDB as a storage.  

> At this moment the bundle is still not ready for production, but it will be very soon!

### Installation
The recommended way to install the bundle is through Composer:  
```
$ composer require emag-tech-labs/messenger-mongo-bundle
```
### Configuration
```yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            hello_queue:
                dsn: mongo://default
                options:
                    database: symfony # required
                    collection: hello_messages # default is "messenger_queue"
                    queue: hello_queue # default in "default"
                    redeliver_timeout: 4800 # default is 3600
```
The **dsn** parameter must be prefixed with **mongo://** followed by the name of the preferred Document Manager configured in **config/packages/doctrine_mongodb.yaml** at **doctrine_mongodb.document_managers**.  
          
As an alternative, you could define the transport using the following shortcut:
```yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            hello_queue:
                dsn: mongo://default?database=symfony&collection=hello_messages&queue=hello_queue&redeliver_timeout=4800
```
